Moved console level to the 1st parameter. Make it quicker and easier to create a console logger
Chaned default console level to INFO from WARNING. This is what I typically end up using anyway
Updated the home page to our new logging_handler page: https://www.learningtopi.com/python-modules-applications/python_logging_handler/
Allow passing static values DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR and CRITICAL from the logging module (or you may import from this library)
